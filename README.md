# Tucker - Online Shopping Portal for Small & Independent Grocers

Welcome to Tucker!

The Tucker platform is THE tool for small grocery stores to connect with their local customers in the online marketplace. Customers can find stores in their neighborhood, keep up to date with current specials and offerings, and even place orders for pick-up and delivery.


The Story:
For the about 60.000 independent grocery and specialty food stores in the U.S., it's getting harder to compete in marketplace against traditional grocery store chains, not to mention the emergence and rise of online retailers like Jet and Amazon in the grocery space.

Many of these grocery stores cater to their local clients' tastes and preferences, and can deliver a better customer experience than a national chain that serves a wider audience. 

We created Tucker to help these independent stores serve their customers in a new domain: the web. Tucker gives them the ability to deliver their great customer experience online.

For their customers, they'll now be able to shop locally any time of day and from anywhere. For the mom who doesn't have time to grocery shop inbetween school dropoffs, work, and other engagements, they'll be able to place a pick-up order and have their shopping cart bagged and ready to go.

In urban areas, where customers may not have cars to haul bags and bags of groceries, or for the elderly or disabled, offering delivery for these customers will allow them to buy more than they can carry home, increasing store sales and saving multiple trips.
